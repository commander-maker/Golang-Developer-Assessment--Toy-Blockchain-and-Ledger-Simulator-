//   - Timestamp    : creation time as Unix nanoseconds
//   - Transactions : ordered list of transactions included in this block
//   - PrevHash     : SHA-256 hash of the preceding block (links the chain)
//   - Nonce        : arbitrary integer reserved for future Proof-of-Work mining
//   - Hash         : SHA-256 hash of this block's own contents
